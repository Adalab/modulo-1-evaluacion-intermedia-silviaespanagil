# HTML and CSS: Exercise
## _Simple landing page_
¡Hola!

This is an exercise where I try to use some new knowledge of HTML and CSS in a simple landing page layout ✨

## Requirements 📋

- A responsive landing page
- Header must be fixed when scrolling through the page
- Designer styleguides must be followed

### Built with 🔨
- Visual Code Studio: as code editor
- HTML
- CSS

## Development ⌨️

For this exercise I had to follow all of the designer guidelines. I started drawing the design and boxing it so it would be easier for me to code.

The code was written in mobile first and then all the media queries for other devices were added.
